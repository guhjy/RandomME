This repository contains two directories:
1. Analysis-R : This directory contains the final results of the simulation study (R_Data), 
                The final plots produced (R_Plots), and the scripts used to run the simulation and plot the results (R_Scripts)
2. Data       : This directory contains a data file saved in an .rds format. This data represents a portion of the full SMART cohort. 
                See the above manuscript for details on this dataset and what steps were taken to obtain the dataset in this repository.
                
                
                
To reproduce the results in the manuscript, open the top_smart_32.R file in Analysis-R//R_Scripts.
All steps for the description of the data, the simulation study and the final plots are detailed in order in this file.
